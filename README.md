**Goal**: To predict the ratings of mobile apps based on various features such as app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating.

**Description**: The project aimed to predict the ratings of apps in a play store, with the objective of identifying high-potential apps that could be boosted for greater visibility. The dataset contained information about app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating, etc. The steps involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to predict app ratings. The model used Linear Regression to predict ratings based on various features, and its performance was evaluated using the R² score.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, create and apply function, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, log transform, data visualization, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

**Results**: After cleaning and preprocessing the data (including handling missing values and removing outliers), the model achieved an R² score on the training set, indicating its ability to predict app ratings. The feature engineering steps included applying logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and one-hot encoding categorical variables. This project provides a predictive model that can help identify apps with high potential ratings.
